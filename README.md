#  Submarine Sonar Simulator – *“Eyes in the Depths”*

A sonar interface simulation inspired by the tension of the **Cuban Missile Crisis**, where underwater detection was crucial.  
This project recreates a **minimalist yet functional sonar system** using **Java Swing**, paying tribute to ingenuity under pressure and the pursuit of vital information.

---

##  Features
- **Intuitive GUI**: Built with `javax.swing`, displayed in a full-screen borderless `JFrame`.  
- **Continuous Animation**: Radar beam updated every 50 ms with `ActionListener` for smooth scanning.  
- **Clear Visual Representation**:
  - Black background → deep ocean environment.  
  - Green concentric rings → sonar distance ranges.  
  - Radial lines every 45° → cardinal/intercardinal directions.  
  - Rotating semi-transparent green beam → scanning for targets.  
- **Precise Motion Logic**: Beam angle increments by 2° per update for constant rotation.

##  How to Run
### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11+** (modules required).  

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GabrielSantana1996sp/Submarine.git
   cd Submarine
   ```
2. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac -d out src/main/java/module-info.java src/main/java/radarSubmarine/*.java
   ```
   *(If using modules, adjust with `--module-source-path` as needed.)*
3. Run:
   ```bash
   java --module-path out -m Submarine/radarSubmarine.radar_Submarine_sonar
   ```
4. The sonar interface will launch in full screen.
